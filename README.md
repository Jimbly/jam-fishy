Game Jam - Fishy
============================

Worlds FRVR Game Jam - Fishy Entry by Jimbly - "Name TBD"

* Play here: [dashingstrike.com/LudumDare/fishy/](http://www.dashingstrike.com/LudumDare/fishy/)
* Using [Javascript libGlov/GLOV.js framework](https://github.com/Jimbly/glovjs)

Start with: `npm start` (after running `npm i` once)

Overall flow options:
* 3 days of fishing
 * Day is a fixed number of fish, or a fixed amount of time?
 * Spend XP between days
 * Fish get harder each day (weird unable to catch up if behind, will just fail?)
* Collect the whole set
 * Need to visit 3 locations, use 3 kinds of bait
 * Have just 2 types of fish on each combo, so only a little luck needed, 3x3 fish varieties
* Choose easy/med/hard for each fishing attempt, spend XP between each attempt
 * Overall is limited by time spent fishing in minigame itself (second "day progress" bar)

TODO:
* Overall flow
